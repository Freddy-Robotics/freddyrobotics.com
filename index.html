        <h3>Frequently asked questions:</h3>
        <b>How does Freddy work?</b>
        <p>Freddy uses it's camera to constantly scan it's surroundings, identifying objects and faces using Google's Tensorflow AI locally. Once Tensorflow has recognized a face in the image-frame alongside a meal, it will blur any faces within the image and send it to the GPT-4o-mini API for processing, which is able to estimate your foods nutritional details and grade your meal's overall nutrition score (A-F) with reasnonable accuracy. These results are then viewable in our mobile-app for parents.</p>
        <b>How do allergen notifications work?</b>
        <p>Parents add a list of potential allergens during setup, and sets a priority level. When Freddy's camera detects any of of these potential allergens in camera using GPT-4o, we'll immediately send a notification to the attached parent, alongside any other contact information listed (your nanny, daycare facility, etc.). Parents can also adjust the confidence level, or likelyhood to trigger a false alarm. </p>
