        <h3>Frequently asked questions:</h3>
        <b>How does Freddy work?</b>
        <p>Freddy uses it's camera to constantly scan it's surroundings, identifying objects and faces using Google's Tensorflow AI locally. Once Tensorflow has recognized a face in the image-frame alongside a meal, it will blur any faces within the image and send it to the GPT-4o API for processing, which is able to estimate your foods nutritional details with reasnonable accuracy. These results are then store in-app for parents to see.</p>
        <b>How do allergen notifications work?</b>
        <p>Parents add a list of potential allergens during setup, and sets a priority level. When Freddy's camera detects any of of these potential allergens in camera using GPT-4o, we'll immediately send a notification to the attached parent, alongside any other contact information listed (your nanny, daycare facility, etc.). Parents can also adjust the confidence level, or likelyhood to trigger a false alarm. </p>
        <b>Why so expensive?</b>
        <p>Freddy takes advantage of the latest AI micro-computing technology available, boasting an Raspberry Pi5 with 8Gb RAM alongside a Google Coral TPU, so it can run AI against it's camera at 30fps locally, without sending any data to external vendors.</p>
